# Multiple Inheritance

  ----->      One Child class extends more than one parent class.
  and If we have to same method or variables in the parent class 
  so the Child class will confuse and cause ambiguity.  that why ->

  ----->  $ It is Not supported in Java


  ? ?
  So how you will implement such kind of Properties in java Because there can be use cases where you
  need to implement such kind of things.

  --> You will do it Using Interfaces


This is Java Not C++.
here we don't deal with pointers.
In C++ we have pointers by which we can resolve ambiguity .
we were able to resolve diamond Problem .

Because java does not support Pointer we don't have
 something called "Multiple Inheritance".
