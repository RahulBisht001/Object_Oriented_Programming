# Abstraction

----> Hiding unnecessary details and showing valuable information

example ->      
            if you are running a Car  you just need a key to start the car 
and run the car but the internal implementation of the car like how the engine
works, how the mechanics of the whole car is working , how the petrol is going , 
how the breaks are working that are important but they are not necessary for 
you to know to start a car. 

This is Abstraction  > Hiding the important but unnecessary Data
