### Packages

In Java, a package is a way to organize classes and interfaces into a hierarchical 
structure. Packages provide a mechanism for grouping related classes and interfaces, 
and help to prevent naming conflicts between classes that have the same name but 
are defined in different packages. Here are some key points about packages in Java:

1. Packages are declared at the top of a Java source file, before the import and 
class statements. The syntax for declaring a package is as follows:

```java
package com.example.myapp;
```

2. Package names should be in all lowercase letters, and should reflect the organization 
of the classes and interfaces within the package. By convention, package names are often 
structured as a series of names separated by dots, with the top-level package typically 
being the organization's domain name in reverse order.

3. Classes and interfaces that are declared within a package must include the package 
name as part of their fully-qualified name. For example, if a class MyClass is declared 
within the com.example.myapp package, its fully-qualified name would be 
`com.example.myapp.MyClass`.

4. Java includes a number of standard packages, such as java.lang, java.util, and 
java.io. These packages contain commonly-used classes and interfaces that are included 
with the Java runtime environment.

5. To use a class or interface from another package, you must either import the 
package or use its fully-qualified name. For example, to use the java.util.ArrayList 
class, you could either import the java.util package as follows:
