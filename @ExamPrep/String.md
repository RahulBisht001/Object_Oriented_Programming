### Mutable and Immutable Strings

In Java, strings are objects that represent sequences of characters. The concept of mutable and 
immutable strings refers to whether or not the content of a string object can be changed after it 
is created.

1. Immutable Strings:
   In Java, strings are immutable by default. This means that once a string object is created, its value cannot be modified. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string object with the modified value. The original string remains unchanged.

   For example:
   ```java
   String str1 = "Hello";
   String str2 = str1.concat(" World");

   System.out.println(str1); // Output: Hello
   System.out.println(str2); // Output: Hello World
   ```

2. Mutable Strings:
   Although Java strings are immutable by default, there are mutable alternatives available. One such mutable string class is `StringBuilder`. The `StringBuilder` class provides a way to create and manipulate mutable strings.

   With `StringBuilder`, you can modify the content of a string without creating a new object each time. `StringBuilder` is designed to be more efficient for situations where you need to perform a series of string manipulations.

   Here's an example using `StringBuilder`:
   ```java
   StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
   sb.append(" World");

   System.out.println(sb.toString()); // Output: Hello World
   ```
   
   Mutable strings like `StringBuilder` can be useful when you need to perform frequent modifications to a string, as they avoid the overhead of creating multiple string objects.

It's important to note that while `StringBuilder` allows mutable strings, the resulting string should be converted to an immutable string using the `toString()` method if you want to ensure immutability.
