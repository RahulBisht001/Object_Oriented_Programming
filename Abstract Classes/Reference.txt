-----> These are Basically the Child class Responsibility to provide the essentials
definition for the Abstract methods.
their is not implementation in the parent class(super class) so it is important that
child class must override them

$ A class that contains one or more than one Abstract methods , must be declared as a Abstract class


Question __
Why we need Abstract Classes?
.   The Answer is,  it looks cleaner. if we know that the methods in the parent classes 
will be overridden so make them Abstract


Question __
Can we create Objects of Abstract classes?
.  No we can't because if we are able to create the objects of Abstract class then if we will
call the Abstract methods of the class it will give us error . 
. Why ?
because Abstract methods does't have body.

Question __
Can we create Abstract constructor?
. No , Same reason given above


Question __
Can we create static methods in the Abstract class ?
. Yes ;
because static methods are object independent. We call static methods using 
class name(Good Practice). So don't need any Object for it


Question __
Can we have the final Abstract class?
No . For the Obvious reasons;
because Final Keyword prevent the class to be inherited
